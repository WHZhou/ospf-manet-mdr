Description: Mobile Routing variant of Quagga
 The Mobile Routing variant of Quagga (http://www.quagga.net/) is a
 research implementation of OSPF MANET Designated Routers (MDRs) that
 implements the following RFCs:
 .
   - RFC 5614 Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Extension of OSPF Using
	      Connected Dominating Set (CDS) Flooding
 .
   - RFC 5243 OSPF Database Exchange Summary List Optimization
 .
   - RFC 5838 Support of Address Families in OSPFv3
 .
 The implementation adds additional features beyond what is specified
 in the above RFCs based on experience with emulations and WiFi-based
 field experiments.
